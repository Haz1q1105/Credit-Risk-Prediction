# Credit-Risk-Prediction
Performing Logisitcal Regression on determining whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan.

# Objective:
Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan.

# Dataset Used:
Name: Loan Prediction Dataset
Source: Kaggle 

# Tools used:
Python
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Numpy
Pandas
Sklearn
Jupyter

# Approach:

1. Loaded the Dataset into the Jupyter Notebook
2. Verfied any missing values, inconsistencies in data
3. Performed Data Preprocessing and Data Cleaning
4. Perfomed EDA by using Matplotlib and Seaborn
5. Prepared a model and performed pre requisites needed for model preparation
6. Determined the accuracy and Confusion Matrix for better understanding
7. Concluded the project with a conclusion markdown

# Results:
The model appears to show an accuracy of 0.788 / 78%. Model is working well and predicts whether to approve or reject loans based on person's credibility 
Confusion matrix also displayed output which has been included in the jupyter notebook with all key insights with comments and conclusion paragraph at the end
